Anime fans may be able to take the talky portentousness, but the ideas are ridiculous.', 'Chris Michael': \"We're in a post-9/11 world plagued with terror attacks. Is it an American corporate conspiracy? Or the work of a deity? Cue the obligatory second-half metaphysical blather.\", 'Jennifer Tate': \"The cyborgs' epic search for 'His Voice' quickly becomes a little tenuous and ridiculous, pushing the film into maddening and tedious territory.\", 'Ben Mortimer': 'One of the most ambitious and interesting movies of the last few years.', 'Siobhan Synnot': \"Terrific-looking action sequences alternate with less terrific expository chat. Despite the natter, it's all mildly baffling.\", 'Stephen Kelly': 'Ambitious, perhaps, but hardly entertaining.', 'Owen Williams': 'A disappointingly dated and unpowered Manga update.', 'Anton Bitel': 'The blending of 3DCG characters and traditionally drawn backgrounds offers a spectacular hybrid playground in which half-human robots can work through the shifting allegiances and crises of faith that have marked the new millennium.'}",
         "{'Anna Smith': 'A less gripping, if bleaker, take on the Kidulthood/Adulthood theme, with a few musical numbers thrown in. Authentic, perhaps, but far from a deeply rewarding cinematic experience.', 'Trevor Johnston': 'Woolcock deserves praise for ambition, but this tumbles awkwardly into some netherworld between streetwise musical and social-conscience crime chronicle.', 'Ali Catterall': \"You could call this a 'hip-hopera', a mix of filmmaking and social work, or a shot in the arm for British independent cinema. Just don't call it Bugsy Malone with real bullets.\", 'Kevin Maher': \"It's propulsive stuff that credibly mixes social realism with bursts of musical energy. Just occasionally, though, the movie falls for the gangland glamour - loving shots of guns, cars and posturing bad boys - it claims to despise.\", 'Peter Bradshaw': \"By turns gloomy, frenzied, downbeat and violently melodramatic, Penny Woolcock's gang grime musical throbs intermittently with energy.\", 'Tim Robey': \"Woolcock doesn't strictly glamourise this guns-'n'-babymothers lifestyle, but her shortcuts to gritty pathos are nearly as questionable.\", 'Priscilla Eyles': 'Woolcock has overcome all odds to produce one of the best British flicks since This Is England.', 'Derek Malcolm': \"Undoubtedly well acted and shot, and with a rip-roaring hip-hop score, it's impressively non-moralistic, just showing us how it is. That may be why Birmingham's cinemas have refused to show it.\", 'Sam Wigley': 'The film has a cheeky comic streak that offsets all the streetwise grandstanding.', 'Nigel Andrews': 'A gangsta farrago, convincing neither as street-tough crime drama nor soul-motorised rap show. The performers go through the motions, and emotions, as if reading cue cards.', 'Anthony Quinn': 'The street patois is at times incomprehensible, the plot is a joke and the music is absurdly aggressive.', 'Matthew Turner': \"1 Day is something of a mixed bag but it's ultimately worth seeing for the energy and commitment of its fired-up cast of unknowns.\", 'Robbie Collin': 'The performances are quality and the rapping, written and performed by the cast, is SUPERB - if anything, the film could have done with a lot more of it.', 'Alistair Harkness': \"It's a noble endeavour, but not a particularly successful one, primarily because her cast, as authentic as they are, don't really have the dramatic skills.\"}"

Shaffer': 'An outstanding look at the enormously dysfunctional relationship between a creator and his adoring fans.', 'Felix Vasquez Jr.': 'Really a testament to the hollow fruitless worship of the Star Wars Saga...', 'Christian Toto': \"The visionary behind 'Star Wars' could learn a thing or two from the smart, and richly comic, documentary The People vs. George Lucas\", 'Josh Bell': \"A skillfully edited, wide-ranging look at a subject that's very close to many movie fans' hearts.\", 'Matt Singer': 'A devastating indictment of our modern geek culture of entitlement.', 'Ed Whitfield': \"... The Modesto Merchandiser did a generation's imagining for them and left these kids with a mortgage sized bill for services rendered.\", 'Lisa Kennedy': 'Eentertaining if mildly worrisome.', 'J. R. Jones': 'This look at Star Wars fanatics and their love-hate relationship with George Lucas turns out to be more interesting than most fanboy docs because director Alexandre O. Philippe touches on some fairly knotty matters of film history and creative ownership.', 'Rich Cline': 'This thoroughly entertaining documentary will appeal mostly to people just like me: those who were total Star Wars obsessives starting back in 1977.', 'Mike Scott': \"The nerd-rage on display when discussing Lucas' ceaseless tinkering with his films -- to say nothing of the midi-chlorians debate -- is ... plenty entertaining.\", 'Fr. Chris Carpenter': 'Entertaining...Director Alexandre O. Philippe incorporates an impressive amount of footage not only from the \"Star Wars\" movies but from the many fan films and spoofs that have been produced.', 'Gary Goldstein': 'You don\\'t have to be a \"Star Wars\" nut to enjoy this fast-paced film, though it\\'s sure to resonate most with those whose childhoods - and beyond - were shaped by the 1977 phenomenon.', 'Joe Neumaier': 'If you\\'re a Force completist, this is as crucial as a bootleg of 1978\\'s \"Star Wars Holiday Special.\" Which, by the way, was awesome.', 'Mark Keizer': 'It catalogues and recalls events so vividly that it will become a communal experience for those with conflicted feelings about Luke, Han and those stupid, furry things from Episode VI.', 'Mike Hale': 'There\\'s a lot of anger floating around in \"The People vs.,\" but Mr. Philippe somehow manages to make the overall tone good-hearted, and he ends on a sentimental note of exasperated love for the man frequently referred to as \"the creator.\"', 'Kyle Smith': '\\'The People vs. George Lucas\" is an open- and-shut case, but that doesn\\'t mean it can\\'t also be an entertaining one.', 'Ethan Alter': 'Despite the provocative title, this Star Wars-themed documentary is less effective as a legal brief than as a portrait of contemporary fandom.', 'Elise Nakhnikian': \"Smart, funny, and often impassioned, it's entertaining even when it's just exploring the filmmaker's relationship with his rebellious army of fans.\", 'David Fear': \"You'll wish you could escape to a galaxy far, far away.\", 'Karina Longworth': \"It's an exhausting airing of nerd grievances, the monolithic arguments leavened only slightly by counterpoints seemingly inserted for comic relief.\", 'Edward Douglas': \"Even those who aren't as fanatical should be able to appreciate the enthusiasm and energy people are willing to put into something they love and hate as much as they do George Lucas' 'Star Wars' movies.\", 'Marshall Fine': 'A novelty item, but an often entertaining one.', 'Brian Orndorf': \"More concentrated on surface fears than penetrating hardened geek exteriors, failing to connect an clear argument worth the time invested.

But what I see hardly captivates me. [Full review in Spanish]', 'Dennis Schwartz': \"It's based on the gripping three-character play by Ariel Dorfman.\", 'Kim Newman': 'Even by their high standards, the performances of Weaver and Kingsley here are impressive, and Polanski ratchetts up the tension nicely. A chilling and thought-provoking piece.', 'Jonathan Rosenbaum': 'Polanski certainly gets the maximum voltage and precision out of his story and actors, keeping us preternaturally alert to shifting power relationships and delayed revelations.', 'Todd McCarthy': \"Kingsley shrewdly tantalizes the viewer about his identity, and gets to deliver the text's most riveting monologue at the end. The lesser-known Wilson may be the first among equals, impressing strongly as the equivocating husband.\", 'Susan Granger': nan, 'Rob Gonsalves': 'Polanski kicks the movie up to a level of emotional violence rare in English-speaking films&#46;', 'Neil Cohen': nan, 'Jake Euker': nan, 'Emanuel Levy': \"Polanksi's direction is crisp and precise but he doesn't resolve basic problems of the stage-to-screen transfer: The tale is claustrophobic (mostly limited to one set) and schematic, with all three characters serving as ideological mouthpieces.\", 'Jeffrey M. Anderson': 'A relentless, superb thriller.', 'Geoff Andrew': 'Polanski wisely never opens out the action from the remote clifftop house. In keeping things claustrophobic, close-up and ambivalent, he heightens the suspense (not to mention the sexual tension).', 'Cole Smithey': nan, \"Chuck O'Leary\": nan, 'Fred Topel': nan, 'Michael Dequina': nan, 'Andy Klein': nan, 'Jon Niccum': nan, 'Rebecca Murray': nan, 'Daniel M. Kimmel': nan, 'Carol Cling': nan, 'Robin Clifford': nan, 'Bill Chambers': 'At once caustic and sincere.', 'Nick Schager': \"Roman Polanski's underappreciated 1994 thriller Death and the Maiden confronts a litany of moral conundrums regarding guilt, revenge, punishment, justice, and man's responsibility to himself and society.\", 'Susan Tavernetti': nan, 'Caryn James': 'Mr. Polanski treads lightly on the clumsier lines, and sustains tension by creating an elegant, unobtrusive dance with the camera.', 'Oz': 'Gripping stuff.', 'John Esther': 'Weaver and Kingsley move.', 'Caffeinated Clint': \"They haven't made a stellar film like this in years. Wonderfully performed.\", 'Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat': 'Probes the moral edge of anger that feeds the passionate pursuit of justice.', 'Erik Childress': nan, 'Ken Hanke': 'Powerful story and acting, but fairly faceless direction from Polanski', 'Philip Martin': nan, 'Scott Weinberg': 'The premise grabs you early and the actors keep you watching.', 'Mick LaSalle': 'Death and the Maiden forces the audience to confront questions about torture and punishment.', 'Peter Travers': 'Polanski keeps the situation ambiguous to provoke questions of guilt and responsibility.', 'Steve Rhodes': 'Have yourself some fun and try to guess the ending. You will find there are many possibilities from which to choose.', 'Mark R. Leeper': 'Powerful, intelligent, and suspenseful.', 'Scott Rosenberg': 'The lesson shapes the drama, rather than arising from it.', 'Desson Thomson': 'The Polanski touch -- apart from a little suspense here and there -- is limited.', 'James Berardinelli': \"Any degree of tension cultivated by Polanski is frequently undermined by Rafael Yglesias and Ariel Dorfman's sputtering script.\", 'Chris Hicks': \"The more serious problem here is Polanski's decision to keep the film housebound, using only camera movements to break things up. The result is a stilted, claustrophobic effect.\", 'Roger Ebert': 'Richer than its materials might promise.', 'Marc Savlov': 'A streamlined razor-ride of a movie: taut, riveting, and a psychological horror show that will leave nail-marks in your palms for days afterwards.', 'Christopher Null': 'A haunting and powerful work of genius.', 'Scott Renshaw': 'It is sabotaged by actors who often appear not to have the faintest idea what to do with the material.', 'Hal Hinson': \"The fundamental strength of Weaver's personality doesn't work here. Nor does her particular style of rage and sorrow.\"}\n",
