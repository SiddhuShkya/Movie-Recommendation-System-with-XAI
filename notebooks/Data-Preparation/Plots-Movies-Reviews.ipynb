Anime fans may be able to take the talky portentousness, but the ideas are ridiculous.', 'Chris Michael': \"We're in a post-9/11 world plagued with terror attacks. Is it an American corporate conspiracy? Or the work of a deity? Cue the obligatory second-half metaphysical blather.\", 'Jennifer Tate': \"The cyborgs' epic search for 'His Voice' quickly becomes a little tenuous and ridiculous, pushing the film into maddening and tedious territory.\", 'Ben Mortimer': 'One of the most ambitious and interesting movies of the last few years.', 'Siobhan Synnot': \"Terrific-looking action sequences alternate with less terrific expository chat. Despite the natter, it's all mildly baffling.\", 'Stephen Kelly': 'Ambitious, perhaps, but hardly entertaining.', 'Owen Williams': 'A disappointingly dated and unpowered Manga update.', 'Anton Bitel': 'The blending of 3DCG characters and traditionally drawn backgrounds offers a spectacular hybrid playground in which half-human robots can work through the shifting allegiances and crises of faith that have marked the new millennium.'}",
         "{'Anna Smith': 'A less gripping, if bleaker, take on the Kidulthood/Adulthood theme, with a few musical numbers thrown in. Authentic, perhaps, but far from a deeply rewarding cinematic experience.', 'Trevor Johnston': 'Woolcock deserves praise for ambition, but this tumbles awkwardly into some netherworld between streetwise musical and social-conscience crime chronicle.', 'Ali Catterall': \"You could call this a 'hip-hopera', a mix of filmmaking and social work, or a shot in the arm for British independent cinema. Just don't call it Bugsy Malone with real bullets.\", 'Kevin Maher': \"It's propulsive stuff that credibly mixes social realism with bursts of musical energy. Just occasionally, though, the movie falls for the gangland glamour - loving shots of guns, cars and posturing bad boys - it claims to despise.\", 'Peter Bradshaw': \"By turns gloomy, frenzied, downbeat and violently melodramatic, Penny Woolcock's gang grime musical throbs intermittently with energy.\", 'Tim Robey': \"Woolcock doesn't strictly glamourise this guns-'n'-babymothers lifestyle, but her shortcuts to gritty pathos are nearly as questionable.\", 'Priscilla Eyles': 'Woolcock has overcome all odds to produce one of the best British flicks since This Is England.', 'Derek Malcolm': \"Undoubtedly well acted and shot, and with a rip-roaring hip-hop score, it's impressively non-moralistic, just showing us how it is. That may be why Birmingham's cinemas have refused to show it.\", 'Sam Wigley': 'The film has a cheeky comic streak that offsets all the streetwise grandstanding.', 'Nigel Andrews': 'A gangsta farrago, convincing neither as street-tough crime drama nor soul-motorised rap show. The performers go through the motions, and emotions, as if reading cue cards.', 'Anthony Quinn': 'The street patois is at times incomprehensible, the plot is a joke and the music is absurdly aggressive.', 'Matthew Turner': \"1 Day is something of a mixed bag but it's ultimately worth seeing for the energy and commitment of its fired-up cast of unknowns.\", 'Robbie Collin': 'The performances are quality and the rapping, written and performed by the cast, is SUPERB - if anything, the film could have done with a lot more of it.', 'Alistair Harkness': \"It's a noble endeavour, but not a particularly successful one, primarily because her cast, as authentic as they are, don't really have the dramatic skills.\"}"

For those who can appreciate it, this is an unquestionable masterpiece.\", 'Nicolas Rapold': \"If Heidecker's not holding a mirror up to our idiocy Borat-style, there's no mistaking the echoes in a thin-skinned, name-calling brute elbowing his way onto political center stage for the ugliest reasons.\", 'Jennie Kermode': \"There's no additional wit here, no insider perspective and no investment in character. Most of what we're presented with was improvised and that's what it looks like -- a small group of not particularly charismatic actors winging it.\", 'Morgan Troper': 'At best, it plays like a bizarro version of The War Room.', 'Nadine Smith': \"Mister America does provide the most succinct summation thus far of the On Cinema mythology, even if it can't quite approximate the experience of the show itself.\", 'Andy Crump': 'The film means to deride that power through representation and succeeds -- but too well, both for its own good and the good of the audience.', 'Adam Patterson': 'This ever-growing mythology is impressive, creating a satirical monster that continues to grow more and more tentacles while cleverly lambasting one topic after another.', 'Ignatiy Vishnevetsky': \"Running only a little shorter than the average season of On Cinema At The Cinema, it's never as cringe-inducingly funny or inventive as the webseries that spawned it.\", 'Carson Lund': \"The long and circuitous narrative history of the so-called OCU weighs heavily on Eric Notarnicola's film.\", 'Gary Goldstein': 'Prolific actor-comedian-musician Tim Heidecker may have a sizable cult following but it\\'s doubtful he\\'ll find many new fans with his latest effort, the tedious and laugh-free mockumentary \"Mister America.\"', 'Nicholas Laskin': 'If nothing else, Mister America cements Tim Heidecker as one of our more unique and uncompromising comic visionaries.', 'Joey Magidson': \"You're either on board with Tim Heidecker and his style or you're not. Here, I was not. Frankly, the film is just not funny at all.\", 'David Ehrlich': \"Heidecker's comedy thrives in the liminal space between what's supposed to be funny and what's not, and the one thing he can't afford to do is stop to explain the joke.\", 'Mark Dujsik': \"Not too long into this movie ... one realizes that the filmmakers don't have much to say about the character ... or politics.\", 'Nick Allen': \"Mister America ambles through two overlapped realities (On Cinema's and our own) and reveals a pathos that makes its dry political comedy accessible beyond an ingrained fanbase, if not poignant.\", 'Patrick Cavanaugh': \"While it's humorous and entertaining throughout, Mister America is a tremendous victory for Heidecker, Turkington, and On Cinema fans for its existence alone.\", 'Frank Scheck': 'A witless, one-note political satire whose deficiencies are even more glaring when such humor feels entirely redundant to our current state of affairs.', 'David Bax': 'Mister America succeeds in unexpected ways by centering humanity and heart amidst the sarcasm and misanthropy.', 'Blake Goble': \"Mister America aims for the acerbic pitch of a '70s alternative political farce like The Candidate, but the parting feeling is that it's just an overdeveloped ramble.\", 'Louis Proyect': 'Don\\'t expect Comedy Central type fluff. This is dark comedy perfectly suited to the period we are living through and much more penetrating than \"Joker\".', 'Ben Kenigsberg': 'Although \"Mister America\" has inspired moments throughout, Tim\\'s ignorance, insensitivity and ill-fitting tailoring aren\\'t really good for 90 minutes of laughs.', 'Candice Frederick': 'Underscores recognizable themes no less irritating in mockumentary form than they are in real life: white supremacy, miscarriages of justice, and racial disenfranchisement. But the film needs to say something about it rather than merely hold up a mirror.', 'Daniel Kurland': \"Whether you're aware of On Cinema's decade-long past... or just admire gonzo experimental filmmaking, Mister America is an immensely satisfying triumph.\", 'Danielle Solzman': \"While there's nothing inherently groundbreaking in Mister America, the film should play for some solid laughs among On Cinema fans.\", 'Peter Debruge': 'The movie amounts to a few weak gags stretched out to feature length.', 'Rendy Jones': 'I don\\'t know how many \"On Cinema\" fans there are in this world, but believe me when I say that this is specifically for you.', 'Evan Dossey': 'Unclear how well this will work for audiences not immersed in the On Cinema universe, but it should really hit the spot for members of the On Cinema Family. Oscar, are you watching?', 'Roger Moore': 'Painfully unfunny. Excruciating. For Tim Heidecker cultists only.'}\n",

But the wealth of talent (Pearl Bailey, Sammy Davis, Dorothy Dandridge, Sidney Poitier, Diahann Carroll, Brock Peters and Leslie Scott) play It as if it were a labor of love.', 'Izzy Rowe': 'Goldwyn has done much with it and has given It a dignity and a meaning which never showed through before. He has eliminated the speaking dialect and has given the music a cloak of color which stands your ears on tip-toe.', 'Raoul Abdul': 'I shall never forget how deeply moved I was in a stage version when...

In this costly new film, at that tragic moment I only thought of what a beautiful shot the cameraman had achieved.', 'Loren Miller': \"Gershwin's music and the general high level of the acting make the movie palatable, but leave it Porgy.

That's Porgy and Bess.\", 'Marjory Adams': \"As to the players, Dorothy Dandridge as Bess and Sidney Poitier as Porgy couldn't be improved... Sammy Davis Jr. is the evil schemer, Sportin' Life, and he does his own singing -- which is hard, smart and persuasively cynical.\", 'Clyde Reid': 'One good thing about the production is that lots of our younger starlets and budding male stars got a chance to \"spread their wings and strut their stuff\" before a major audience.

Cohen': 'Somewhere in Porgy and Bess something is missing. The bursting excitement, in the main. The transfer from the stage to the screen has been accomplished with conscientiousness but without inspiration.', 'George Bourke': '[A] near perfect bit of cinematic art.', 'Jay Carmody': 'Verve and vitality have been sacrificed in the big picture directed by Otto Preminger in favor of spectacle and sentimentality.', 'Helen Bower': 'This Porgy... has done its best to meet the challenge of turning an operetta of this nature into popular entertainment. If it sometimes seems slowed or stagey, the form of the musical melodrama rather than the film itself may have made this unavoidable.', 'Mae Tinee': \"Technically, it's a superb example of painstaking and polished film-making, and, altho there are times when it lacks life and motion, it's still very well worth seeing.\", 'George S. Schuyler': 'This American classic is written, played and presented with a dignity and artistry that so representative an example of American culture deserves.', 'Myles Standish': '[Poitier and Dandridge] convey the torrent of emotion strongly, reinforced by the luminous singing voices of Robert McFerrin and Adele Addison, which were dubbed in.', 'John Bustin': 'Of course, the principal ingredients -- the haunting musical score and the poignant story -- were already on hand, but this production enhances them greatly with a staging that is rich, artful and altogether stirring in every sense.', 'Penelope Gilliatt': \"Otto Preminger's film is ponderous and flat. It has nothing like the spirit of, for instance, his own Carmen Jones.\", 'Philip K. Scheuer': 'The praise must go much beyond these technical marvels. Porgy and Bess would not be the masterpiece it is if the 70-mm. film and the seven-channel sound were not equaled by the human element.', 'William Glover': 'Much of the great Gershwin score is sung by backstage performers -- only Miss Bailey and Davis vocalize on the sound track. But the fusing of actors and voices has been done with remarkable skill.', 'R.H. Gardner': 'In their eagerness to leave everything just as Gershwin left it, the adapters have done very little adapting... Aside from this weakness -- and I consider it a major one -- the Goldwyn Porgy is a commendable job.', 'Sherwin Kane': \"The  production shines with memorable individual performances... Sidney Poitier as Porgy, Dorothy Dandridge as Bess, Brock Peters as Crown, Sammy Davis, Jr. as Sportin' Life and Pearl Bailey as Maria are outstanding.\", 'P.S.

Andre Previn's musical direction is inspiring.\", 'Harold Whitehead': \"Perhaps best and the shortest way of praising this film, and it deserves all the accolades it gets, is to say that for anyone who is not familiar with or has never seen George Gershwin's folk opera, this is the finest possible introduction.\", 'Richard Harrity': '[Porgy and Bess]  has been made into a handsome motion picture by that elder genius of the colossal, Mr. Samuel Goldwyn. In fact, the filming of Porgy and Bess is a bit too handsome and a mite  too pretty, thereby sacrificing compassion for color.', 'Jack Curtis': \"The film version of the famous Broadway production certainly has plenty of somethin'. Specifically, there are brilliant splashes of color, intricate set designs, interesting photography, and an outstanding cast.\", 'Bob Blackburn': \"The pace is pretty hot and heavy without the reliefs that might make it a less exhausting experience. But these are faults, and it isn't faults that distinguish this picture. It's technically superb, musically delightful, and altogether rewarding.\", 'Alexander Walker': '[Preminger] washes the Todd-AO screen with filters to give the action \"mood.\" But I am tired of viewing musicals like this... as If through amber ski-goggles. However, shining through all this are the talents of Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge.', 'Colin Bennett': '[Porgy and Bess] is handsomely staged -- and \"staged\" is the operative word. This is not really film, but photographed, opera, set in an operatic frame of reference and moving at stage, not film, pace.', 'Times (UK) Staff': 'The overriding impression, however, is one of set scenes. songs and sequences, with the spotlight thrown less on fluid movement than on the conventions of opera and of theatre. This, in the end, amounts more to a subtraction than an addition.', 'SMH Staff': '[Preminger] has achieved a production that is lovely to the ear, sumptuously sombre to the eye (in cinematographer Leon Shamroy\\'s range of ambers and reds), and. occasionally, moving. The \"occasionally\" is the puzzle.', 'Guardian Staff': \"Samuel Goldwyn's production (directed by Otto Preminger) certainly does full justice to the score and that, where the score is relatively feeble, it bolsters up the dramatic action with devices possible on the screen but not on the stage.\", 'Richard Brody': 'Preminger and the cast overcome the opera’s contrivances and stereotypes to recapture Gershwin’s underlying humanistic vision of celebration and deliverance.', 'TIME Staff': 'Porgy and Bess is only a moderate and intermittent success as a musical show; as an attempt to produce a great work of cinematic art, it is a sometimes ponderous failure.', 'Shadow Stage': 'Producer Samuel Goldwyn and director Otto Preminger have assembled it with such artistry and loving care that it almost seems to have been written for the movies.', 'Emanuel Levy': \"One of the most underestimated movie musicals, based on Gershwin's masterpiece, Porgy and Bess receives a lavish production from Otto Preminger in an all-black, Oscar-nominated picture, starring Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge.\", 'TV Guide Staff': \"The brilliant score by the Gershwins and DuBose Heyward, however, will last forever, while Preminger's veteran cameraman, Leon Shamroy, did a wonderful job and the art direction by Serge Krizman and Joseph Wright is sensational.\", 'Bosley Crowther': 'This is a stunning, exciting and moving film, packed with human emotions and cheerful and mournful melodies. It bids fair to be as much a classic on the screen as it is on the stage.', 'Film4 Staff': \"That it stands as an entertaining spectacle and the director's best musical is secondary in interest to the Hollywood politics surrounding it.\", 'Phil Hall': 'A mediocre curio.', \"Emily O'Neill\": \"Should this Porgy and Bess be locked away?

How our actions and decisions can affect/impact people around us and even in other countries.', 'Mike Massie': 'The acting is exceptional, allowing the loosely connected storylines to garner greater gravity.', 'David Lamble': 'See Babel while it still illuminates a big screen, for all the clues it contains about our times, as we babble more and more about less and less.', 'Mattie Lucas': '[Iñarritu] has captured humanity in all of its flawed glory - fallen yet beautiful, tragic yet hopeful - all crying out to be heard.', 'Namrata Joshi': \"There are moments when a lot is left unsaid. There's a remarkable stillness and delicacy as the music and images interplay and do all the talking.\", 'PJ Nabarro': 'An irredeemably overdetermined, far-fetched and transparently schematic piece.', 'Megan Basham': \"On a practical level it's hard not to see that nearly every calamity in Babel could have been avoided had the characters exercised better judgment\", 'Heather Huntington': nan, 'Matthew Pejkovic': \"Babel is a beautifully depressing film about responsibility, redemption, and ultimately that there are consequences to people's actions, regardless of who they are and where they live.\", 'Fernando F. Croce': \"The gimmick-machinery whirrs, but the human beings in it can't breath\", 'James Wegg': 'Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga have fashioned their ideas with conviction and obvious care.', 'Felix Vasquez Jr.': 'An ensemble cast, low-key drama, and tolerable political commentary make \"Babel\" a gripping success.', 'Brian Marder': nan, 'Jonathan Kiefer': nan, 'Thomas Peyser': 'Babel...belongs to an unfortunately proliferating genre that might be called the higher kitsch.', 'Brandon Fibbs': '...language acts more as a means to distance and isolate us than aid in our understanding of one another.', 'Rob Gonsalves': 'A lumbering&#44; stitched-together mess&#46;', 'Moira Sullivan': 'Babel directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is one of the most compelling films to date.', 'Joe Lozito': nan, 'Anton Bitel': 'an affecting examination of disconnected lives in an interconnected world.', 'Brian Webster': 'Smart, interesting to look at, and courageous, this is one of the best films of 2006.', 'Michael Wade Simpson': \"There is some hope, in Iñárritu's world, each of the characters may have a family and love, but this is shown to be, at best, a diversion against the real world, which is a much more intolerable, incomprehensive place.\", 'Brian Tallerico': 'The kind of film that will echo deep in your soul.', 'Cole Smithey': 'Alejandro González Iñárritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga cap off the trilogy of films that began with \"Amores Perros\" and \"21 Grams\" with a rich and engrossing drama.', 'Michelle Orange': 'A better title for this film would have been \"Murphy\\'s Law,\" as Inarritu has a relentless grip on the banality of its tenets.', 'Mark Holcomb': \"Alejandro González Iñárritu's latest sprawling, dispersed art-film blockbuster prompts a question: Does he just not know how to tell a story?\", 'Alex Sandell': 'Rubbish so pretentious it would make the folks behind Crash begin to blush.', 'Luis Martinez': 'Babel es más que eso, es contradicción y antítesis, es la obra cumbre y gloriosa de un visionario en un retrato triste y dramático de nuestro mundo.', 'Philip French': 'An impressive, beautifully acted work with a tragic sense of life. The formality of its structure controls a seething anger.', 'Peter Bradshaw': 'Well acted and handsomely photographed, but still extraordinarily overpraised and overblown, a middlebrow piece of near-nonsense: the kind of self-conscious arthouse cinema that is custom-tailored and machine-tooled for the dinner-party demographic.', 'Pablo Villaça': 'Acaba trazendo [seu diretor e seu roteirista] em um caminho que já percorreram duas vezes %u2013 só que, aqui, eles o fazem de maneira bem mais esquemática, melodramática e, conseqüentemente, menos interessante.', 'Matthew De Abaitua': \"You can't make the same film three times and not expect people to carp. Go and see it with politically-minded friends and thrash it out afterwards over coffee.\", 'Enrique Buchichio': 'Si algún mérito tiene González Iñárritu (además de la conducción de un buen elenco) es el de haber sido capaz de dar a una película menor y pretenciosa la forma de un cine supuestamente original e importante.', 'Stella Papamichael': \"Babel can be unnecessarily convoluted, ultimately though it's the stark simplicity of the dilemmas faced by each character that hits home, wherever that may be.\", 'Dave Calhoun': 'If misery is your pornography, Babel is your holy grail.', 'Neil Smith': 'For all its contrivances, Babel offers a gripping treatise on fate, chance and language with an epic sweep that leaves you marvelling at its ambition.', 'Mark Adams': 'Well structured, but rather cold.', 'Uri Lessing': \"The film takes its main characters, spreads them out all over the world, and subjects them to emotionally and physically tortuous situations. Think last year's Crash on a global scale.\", 'Ted Murphy': 'The idea of the ripple effect of events has been handled by other movies that I somehow was hoping there would be something deeper or more meaningful in the message of Babel.', \"James O'Ehley\": 'When bad things happen to stupid people, are we supposed to care?', 'Ian Freer': 'It may be too slow for some tastes, but Babel remains emotionally bruising but compulsive viewing.', 'Jordan Hiller': 'The fact that someone was so inspired by our pathetic and pitiable inability to communicate with our fellow man to craft a film with that message and that message alone is noteworthy.', 'David N. Butterworth': '\"Babel\" is a well-intentioned -- and finely acted -- tower of power that might have worked better had its theme of universal communication difficulties been better integrated.', 'Kam Williams': 'Feelbad experiences abound in modern morality play.', 'Urban Cinefile Critics': 'Actions, reactions and consequences are the themes of Babel, an intense and gripping drama that explores the closely connected chain of humanity that links us inextricably to each other.', 'Michael A. Smith': '...once again Pitt has cast aside the exterior to bring out the character inside. A scene where he breaks down and sobs while talking to his son is heartbreaking.', 'Lisa Johnson': \"Iñárritu not only tries to pull the heart strings with children weeping; there's also the completely gratuitous side story about Asian teens in short skirts sans panties.\", 'Victoria Alexander': 'An emotionally visceral and empathetic triumph.', 'Gina Carbone': \"Looking back, there are so many moments of beauty in Babel, mostly born of frustration and empathy with these characters. So why doesn't it connect?\", 'Greg Maki': '... Harrowing, compelling viewing.', 'Rex Roberts': 'Earnest to a fault and depressing beyond reason, the film is unrelenting in its attempts to wrap the world in a shroud of fatalism.', 'Forrest Hartman': \"Babel is arresting thanks to the complexities of the storytelling and Inarritu's deft ability to massage the audience.\", 'Mark R. Leeper': 'This is a moving but very downbeat film. The stories do not add up to much other than to say that bad things happen.', 'Mike McGranaghan': \"Babel is the kind of movie I would recommend to a specific audience. If you don't mind sitting and soaking up the little details and absorbing a theme as deep as it will go, then you may agree that this film is quite rewarding.\", 'James Kendrick': 'a collection of often powerful scenes in search of something grand to say', 'Christopher Smith': 'If you know and love the work of Mexican-born director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, you understand going into his films that you must do so armed with a good deal of trust. His latest, \"Babel,\" is no exception.', 'Ross Anthony': 'Bleak, edgy, hyper-real. Purposely depleted of warm colors. Pitt and Blanchett only appear intermittently (and not terribly dynamically). An art-type film in three countries.', 'Susan Tavernetti': \"Babel doesn't snap pieces of a plot puzzle together to satisfy a viewer. It's not that kind of a film. Immediate gratification comes in the form of vibrant, impressionistic scenes.\", 'John Wirt': \"Babel is skillful filmmaking, but the film's whole is less than its parts. After the drama ends, little has been learned.\", 'Donald Munro': \"Riveting and eloquent. One of the year's best.\", 'Mark Dujsik': \"The film's ambition, unfortunately, exceeds its reach, let alone its grasp.\", 'Robert Roten': 'Similar in tone to Iñárritu\\'s earlier film, \"21 Grams,\" but not as effective.', 'Ken Hanke': \"A film that's more to be admired than liked, more to be thought about than felt. It's a good film -- maybe close to a great one -- but one that I have no desire to revisit.\", 'Steven Snyder': \"It's a complicated film, and at times a convoluted story, which is held together by its impressive array of performances.\", 'Steve Rhodes': 'The lethargically paced Babel alternates between being kind of boring to being mildly interesting', 'Thomas Delapa': \"If Crash drove you to distraction, then thou best stay away from Babel, this year's towering exercise in socio-political-psycho babble.\", 'Linda Cook': 'An amazing, disturbing drama, \"Babel\" is a puzzle of film that pieces itself together bit by bit.', 'Joseph Proimakis': 'full review in Greek', 'Diana Saenger': 'Throughout the film the unpredictability, different and unique characters and the fast pace fuels the intrigue.', 'Beth Accomando': 'Iñárritu is an exceptionally gifted director who makes each individual scene in Babel work beautifully. However, he runs into trouble as he attempts to pull all the plot strands together.', 'Tony Medley': \"While this might not be for everyone, certainly not for the lazy, it is a brilliant piece of movie-making. It grabs you and doesn't let go.\", 'Dennis Schwartz': '... settles for being a decent but contrived and unmoving psychological drama.', 'David Elliott': 'Long, belabored, terminally solemn despite some vigor, and numbingly sentimental under a tough surface, this is a serpentine coiling of three modestly connected and episodic stories.', 'Carla Meyer': \"It's in the more natural-seeming spurts of joy, rather in the less organic moments of crisis, that Babel makes its best argument for a universal experience.\", 'Jack Garner': \"Babel expresses a great yearning for an understanding that straddles all our borders. It's among the best films of the year.\", 'Roger Moore': \"It's a great film made with style and heart and hope, a cautionary parable and an almost certain Oscar contender.\", 'Shawn Levy': 'There are passages in all of his films -- in Babel they include a wedding in Mexico, a car chase in the desert, and a night at a Tokyo disco -- that absolutely bristle with inspired energy and dazzling photography, sound and editing.', 'Rene Rodriguez': \"The experience of watching Babel is undeniably riveting: Even if the film doesn't really lead anywhere, you still can't take your eyes off it.\", 'Robert W. Butler': \"Because of its thematic flaws, Babel isn't the masterpiece some are claiming. Yet it remains powerful stuff, a glum but concerned look at how a seemingly isolated event can affect lives on the other side of the globe.\", 'Jeff Vice': 'The film is not always successful at doing so, and not all of the plot lines work as well as others. But there are strong performances and an intriguing look at the subject matter.', 'John Beifuss': 'Inarritu is the auteur as puppet master -- a Dr. Mabuse of the art house.', 'Amy Biancolli': \"[Iñárritu] remains as entranced as ever by fate, loss and the interconnectedness of humankind, and I admire him for it. But Babel isn't the last or best word on that subject. It's just a lot of talk.\", 'Duane Dudek': 'The result is, ultimately, a portrait of the global village being built on a foundation of bad judgments made in good faith on a daily basis, which we barely survive by the skin of our teeth and through the kindness of strangers.', 'Robert Denerstein': \"True to its title, Babel hinges on missed and faulty communications of both the personal and the cultural variety. It's a sweeping movie about characters who often suffer from tunnel vision.\", \"Sean O'Connell\": \"Finds a tense undercurrent (that) keeps us involved through the film's moderate pace and constant narrative shuffling.\", 'Nick Rogers': 'Being diplomatic because of Inarritu and Arriaga\\'s past success isn\\'t worth it, given the irony that a story about communication breakdown so woefully fails to connect. \"Babel\" is a bore.', 'Michael Booth': 'Babel is the masterful third installment in this trilogy of truth and consequence.', 'Bill Muller': \"As each story comes to its conclusion, some characters rise above, while others are crushed under the weight of the day's events. The tales are equal parts miracle and tragedy. And that's often what life is, which makes Babel ring true.\", 'Alex Billington': 'This is a movie where the intriguing stories are crafted perfectly by a master storyteller.', 'Lori Hoffman': \"... [Alejandro Iñárritu's] plea for improved global communication ... squanders fine performances in a film that is engulfed by the director's pretentious mindset.\", 'Matt Brunson': \"There's a lot to chew over in Babel. But because it's overstuffed, it also means that there's a lot not worth swallowing.\", 'Philip Martin': 'From the past to the present to the future, from savagery to civilization to a kind of cybernetic autism. Babel does what a movie can do. It whisks us away.', 'Daniel M. Kimmel': 'Like the famous Biblical tower, Babel is ultimately too much noise and more of a monument to the ego of its creators than an achievement in itself.', 'Eric D. Snider': 'Has an unwelcome sense of self-importance and heavy-handedness.', 'Nell Minow': \"The film's sympathy for all of its characters is in itself the answer, or at least the beginning of one, to the questions it raises.\", 'Steve Crum': \"Except for the rather contrived Tokyo link, 'Babel' is as good as 'Crash.' It is definitely worth seeing, but take a deep breath first.\", 'Bill Clark': 'How much you enjoy Babel will be based entirely on your degree of cynicism.', 'Richard Roeper': 'One of the most challenging and saddest movies of the year -- and also one of the most memorable.', 'Marc Savlov': \"It's a masterful film, the kind you itch to see twice or more, as elliptical as a dream and as direct as the short sharp shock of lead kissing flesh.\", 'Phoebe Flowers': 'Gripping, patient and utterly enchanting, it is a marked growth for Iñárritu and Arriaga, who have taken a precarious conceit and transformed it into one of the most powerful movies of the year.', 'Lou Lumenick': \"[Babel] is, in short, one of the year's best movies.\", 'Lawrence Toppman': 'At its best, Babel expresses the emotions that link of all of us, even if we have no way to share them. I just wish it did a better job of communicating them.', 'Jonathan Rosenbaum': \"The filmmakers don't seem to understand or care much about many of these people, but they use them to unload ideas about violence, communication, and tribal misunderstandings -- trading on suffering as they aim for cosmic wisdom.\", 'Eleanor Ringel Cater': \"Good intentions don't always make good movies. And this one simply wasn't worth their effort.\", 'James Sanford': \"fascinating, sprawling drama ...an ambitious, engrossing piece of work that builds on the promise shown in Innaritu's first two features.\", 'Phil Villarreal': 'If last year\\'s best-picture Oscar winner, \"Crash,\" argued, \"Can\\'t we all just get along?\" \"Babel\" counters, \"Let\\'s stop traveling and talking to each other.\"', 'John Thomason': \"At two and a half hours, it's never boring but has trouble connecting the disparate characters into a cohesive whole. In fact, the Japanese story, while providing many beautiful, graceful moments, belongs to another movie entirely.\", 'Eric Melin': \"No character is on hand to neatly tie up the film's themes (like how we all Crash into each other), and there is an overall feeling of empathy that does not come at the expense of a realistic ending.\", 'Mark Palermo': \"Through it all is the motif of children at prey in a social order that's ready to destroy them.\", 'Pete Hammond': 'An unqualified triumph from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. World class filmmaking of the highest order.', 'Frank Swietek': \"Like its scriptural model, an impressive structure, but one that doesn't reach the intended emotional heights.\", 'Pete Vonder Haar': \"...here's the most important lesson %u2013 if you're going to a Mexican wedding, make plans to spend the night.\", 'Cherryl Dawson and Leigh Ann Palone': 'This is one of those movies that would work better at home, where you could pause the tape when you need to take a break or fast forward when things start to slow down too much.', 'Ty Burr': \"For a movie that insists on the truth of humanity's mutual dependency, Babel feels disconnected from anything but its own artistic determinism.\", 'Dustin Putman': 'Thought-provoking long after its haunting final frame, Babel is a weighty and complex spellbinder.', 'Geoff Pevere': 'Babel is supposed to be a cry of humanist anguish that echoes -- in four languages -- around the world. Why does it feel as much like an elaborate game of middlebrow post-millennial Clue?', 'Tom Keogh': 'The film is something to see. But despite the dynamism of all those individual moments, Babel looks like an empty edifice.', 'Mick LaSalle': 'In the end, a film of profound ambition is unmasked as one without real purpose, a misguided attempt to make a serious, important statement despite having nothing, really, to say.', 'Carrie Rickey': 'I was shaken, but not stirred.', 'Gary Thompson': 'Babel feels less like the work of an existential moper and more like the evening news.', 'Bruce Kirkland': \"Dark, sophisticated and challenging, this film is a stunning conclusion to Inarritu's trilogy that began with Amores Perros and 21 Grams.\", 'Tom Long': 'Something of a one-note film, albeit a beautifully played note.', 'Terry Lawson': 'An extension and expansion of 21 Grams in every way, and this time proves too much of a mystical thing.', 'Chris Vognar': 'Individually, the stories are beautifully shot, intimately acted and usually engrossing.', 'Mary F. Pols': \"[Inarritu's] eloquence of delivery is remarkable.\", 'Angela Baldassarre': 'Tragedy is so overwhelming in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu\\'s \"Babel\" that my anxiety increased throughout the viewing.', 'Jeffrey Overstreet': \"Babel is Arriaga's finest script yet.... But, like Amores Perros and 21 Grams, the film feels like a 21-car pile-up of catastrophes.\", 'Matthew Turner': 'The entire ensemble cast give terrific performances, particularly Kikuchi, whose heart-breaking performance is simultaneously shocking, funny and moving.', 'Brian Orndorf': 'I would be surprised if, after 140 minutes of grim punishment, any audience member could be truly moved by this everlasting symphony of pain.', 'Willie Waffle': 'one of the most dramatic, exciting and moving films of the year.', 'William Arnold': 'Holds you tightly within its grip through its lengthy running time and forces you to empathize with a large cast of international characters and their individual quests in a visceral way.', 'Robin Clifford': 'The world-spanning story has intriguing elements...But, the overall study falls short of the individual stories.', 'Stephen Hunter': \"It's pretty -- oh, what's the word? -- stupid in its dramatization of the silly little connections that unite us, and it's somewhat selective in its choice of them.\", 'Chris Hewitt': \"Babel didn't begin to bug me until afterward, when I was thinking about it and realizing there's less to it than meets the eye. Watching it, though, is an often dazzling experience.\", 'Michael Wilmington': 'It sweeps you along in a tide of cinematic energy and high-voltage drama.', 'Todd Gilchrist': 'In his latest film, Babel, director Alejandro Gonzalez intertwines four stories that are overripe with nail-biting potential and then unleashes them on the audience without mercy. And while this may actually rank as the most challenging, difficult,', 'Matt Pais': 'Satisfies as a story of people thousands of miles apart inextricably intertwined, with the snowball of fate already rolling down the hill.', 'Josh Larsen': 'Coincidence can be a heavy burden for a movie...', 'Andrew Sarris': 'The terrorizing of two sets of children a continent apart may strike some viewers -- and does strike this viewer -- as unduly manipulative.', 'Laura Clifford': \"...while the pair's [Iñárritu and Arriaga] filmmaking skills cannot be denied, the film's emotional resonance is weakened by a feeling of repetition and cliche...\", 'Scott Nash': 'Babel is a movie with its heart in the right place, but like its own characters, its message gets lost in translation.', 'Cynthia Fuchs': 'Babel suggests that violence forges its own kind of language, a means to forge closeness across distances of experience, location, and time.', 'Tom Charity': \"For all its apparent scope, the film's in-your-face fatalism ultimately feels forced. The cumulative effect is more grueling than cathartic, even if it may also be good for the soul.\", 'Eric Lurio': \"The acting is terrific, especially Barraza, who manages to carry the entire segment by herself.

      "Movie Plot: Tragedy strikes a married couple on vacation in the Moroccan desert, touching off an interlocking story involving four different families. Four interlocking stories connected by a single gun converge at the end to reveal a complex, tragic story of the lives of humanity around the world and how we truly aren't all that different. In Morocco, a troubled married couple are on vacation trying to work out their differences. Meanwhile, a Moroccan herder buys a rifle for his sons so they can keep the jackals away from his herd. A girl in Japan dealing with rejection, her mother's death, her father's emotional distance, her own self-consciousness, and a disability, deals with modern life in the enormous metropolis of Tokyo, Japan. On the opposite side of the world the married couple's Mexican nanny takes the couple's two children with her to her son's wedding in Mexico, only to meet trouble on the return trip. Combined, it provides a powerful story and an equally-powerful looking glass into the lives of seemingly random people around the world and it shows just how connected we really are. In Morocco, a shepherd buys a powerful rifle for his sons to protect his herd of goats against jackal attacks. The younger decides to test the weapon's range of 3 km and shoots an American woman on a bus--part of a married couple who are trying to mend their marriage with a holiday in Morocco. Due to the incident, in San Diego their Mexican maid travels to Mexico with their children for her son's wedding. Meanwhile in Tokyo, the police try to contact the former owner of the rifle, and his daughter, who is feeling rejected, misunderstands the reason for the investigation. Three concurrent but interrelated stories covering four countries on three continents are presented. Just outside the small town of Tazzarine in the Moroccan desert, goat farmer Abdullah has just purchased a rifle from his neighbor. The rifle is for his eldest son, pre-teen Ahmed, to shoot jackals who have been killing their goats. However, Abdullah's younger son Yussef, who in many ways displays more maturity than his brother, ends up being more natural with the firearm. The boys fool around with it, aiming at various items, testing its shooting distance, and Yussef shoots at a tour bus off in the distance; the boys guess by the actions of the bus that he probably hit it. The two scared boys later learn indirectly that an American tourist was killed on the bu, and they must figure out what to do with this information, which turns out to be incorrect: Susan Jones, did not die immediately from her gunshot wound to the shoulder, but she is seriously wounded. She and her husband Richard were on vacation at the time trying to mend their loving but troubled marriage; they haven't been able to deal with the recent SIDS death of their youngest, Sam. Not only must Richard figure out how to get Susan the medical attention necessary to save her life--the nearest hospital is two hours away--but he must also deal with a busload of fellow passengers who sympathize with the Jones' plight but are concerned about their own health and safety based partly on speculation that Susan's shooting was a terrorist attack. Richard and Susan's time away from their home in San Diego is extended, so their illegal-alien Mexican housekeeper Amelia must continue looking after the Jones' other children, young adolescents Mike and Debbie; however, her own son Luis is getting married in their hometown just across the border in Mexico and Amelia can't find anyone to stay with Mike and Debbie in her absence, so she decides to take them with her, which leads to potential problems as she doesn't have Richard's or Susan's written consent to cross the border with them. She's mainly at the mercy of their chauffeur for the day: her headstrong nephew Santiago. Meanwhile in Tokyo, Chieko Wataya, a deaf teenager, is mourning her mother's recent suicide. At the same time she's reaching her sexual awakening and she's having problems dealing with that because her disability turns off boys her age, so they reject her--so she seeks out that sexual release with older men in inappropriate ways, equating this sex with the love that's now missing from the Wataya household. These issues come to a head when the police come looking for her father, for what she believes is further questioning about whether her mother's death was actually suicide. \"In Gen. 11:9, the name of Babel is etymologized by association with the Hebrew verb balal, 'to confuse or confound'\" (www.wikipedia.org/wiki/babel)...\"Babel\", through a series of misunderstandings, interweaves the unfortunate circumstances of a Moroccan, an American, a Mexican, and a Japanese family. A Moroccan family acquires a rifle to protect their goats. An American woman on a bus tour with her husband is accidentally shot, which is in turn grossly exaggerated by the press, who are quick to label the incident a \"terrorist attack\". The couple's children accompany their long-time caretaker to Mexico to attend her son's wedding, and face problems upon re-entering the United States. A Japanese widower confronts difficulties communicating with his deaf teenage daughter who simply craves human contact. Richard and Susan are a couple from San Diego, California who are vacationing in Morocco while their two children are at home with their Mexican housekeeper Amelia. A rifle finds its way into the hands of a local herdsman's young sons, who recklessly take a shot at a tour bus and hit Susan in the shoulder, causing her severe injury. The distraught Richard calls home to tell Amelia of the situation, who shortly departs for Mexico to attend her son's wedding, with Richard and Susan's children in tow. Disaster thus multiplies, with the situation in Morocco ascribed to terrorists in the media, while Amelia meets with trouble at the Mexican border when she attempts to return to San Diego with Richard and Susan's children. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, a widower tied to the rifle in question, a complex shift of ownership to which the audience is privy, attempts to deal with the memories of his recently-deceased wife and his strained relationship with their deaf teenage daughter.\n",
