Anime fans may be able to take the talky portentousness, but the ideas are ridiculous.', 'Chris Michael': \"We're in a post-9/11 world plagued with terror attacks. Is it an American corporate conspiracy? Or the work of a deity? Cue the obligatory second-half metaphysical blather.\", 'Jennifer Tate': \"The cyborgs' epic search for 'His Voice' quickly becomes a little tenuous and ridiculous, pushing the film into maddening and tedious territory.\", 'Ben Mortimer': 'One of the most ambitious and interesting movies of the last few years.', 'Siobhan Synnot': \"Terrific-looking action sequences alternate with less terrific expository chat. Despite the natter, it's all mildly baffling.\", 'Stephen Kelly': 'Ambitious, perhaps, but hardly entertaining.', 'Owen Williams': 'A disappointingly dated and unpowered Manga update.', 'Anton Bitel': 'The blending of 3DCG characters and traditionally drawn backgrounds offers a spectacular hybrid playground in which half-human robots can work through the shifting allegiances and crises of faith that have marked the new millennium.'}",
         "{'Anna Smith': 'A less gripping, if bleaker, take on the Kidulthood/Adulthood theme, with a few musical numbers thrown in. Authentic, perhaps, but far from a deeply rewarding cinematic experience.', 'Trevor Johnston': 'Woolcock deserves praise for ambition, but this tumbles awkwardly into some netherworld between streetwise musical and social-conscience crime chronicle.', 'Ali Catterall': \"You could call this a 'hip-hopera', a mix of filmmaking and social work, or a shot in the arm for British independent cinema. Just don't call it Bugsy Malone with real bullets.\", 'Kevin Maher': \"It's propulsive stuff that credibly mixes social realism with bursts of musical energy. Just occasionally, though, the movie falls for the gangland glamour - loving shots of guns, cars and posturing bad boys - it claims to despise.\", 'Peter Bradshaw': \"By turns gloomy, frenzied, downbeat and violently melodramatic, Penny Woolcock's gang grime musical throbs intermittently with energy.\", 'Tim Robey': \"Woolcock doesn't strictly glamourise this guns-'n'-babymothers lifestyle, but her shortcuts to gritty pathos are nearly as questionable.\", 'Priscilla Eyles': 'Woolcock has overcome all odds to produce one of the best British flicks since This Is England.', 'Derek Malcolm': \"Undoubtedly well acted and shot, and with a rip-roaring hip-hop score, it's impressively non-moralistic, just showing us how it is. That may be why Birmingham's cinemas have refused to show it.\", 'Sam Wigley': 'The film has a cheeky comic streak that offsets all the streetwise grandstanding.', 'Nigel Andrews': 'A gangsta farrago, convincing neither as street-tough crime drama nor soul-motorised rap show. The performers go through the motions, and emotions, as if reading cue cards.', 'Anthony Quinn': 'The street patois is at times incomprehensible, the plot is a joke and the music is absurdly aggressive.', 'Matthew Turner': \"1 Day is something of a mixed bag but it's ultimately worth seeing for the energy and commitment of its fired-up cast of unknowns.\", 'Robbie Collin': 'The performances are quality and the rapping, written and performed by the cast, is SUPERB - if anything, the film could have done with a lot more of it.', 'Alistair Harkness': \"It's a noble endeavour, but not a particularly successful one, primarily because her cast, as authentic as they are, don't really have the dramatic skills.\"}"

But the wealth of talent (Pearl Bailey, Sammy Davis, Dorothy Dandridge, Sidney Poitier, Diahann Carroll, Brock Peters and Leslie Scott) play It as if it were a labor of love.', 'Izzy Rowe': 'Goldwyn has done much with it and has given It a dignity and a meaning which never showed through before. He has eliminated the speaking dialect and has given the music a cloak of color which stands your ears on tip-toe.', 'Raoul Abdul': 'I shall never forget how deeply moved I was in a stage version when...

In this costly new film, at that tragic moment I only thought of what a beautiful shot the cameraman had achieved.', 'Loren Miller': \"Gershwin's music and the general high level of the acting make the movie palatable, but leave it Porgy.

That's Porgy and Bess.\", 'Marjory Adams': \"As to the players, Dorothy Dandridge as Bess and Sidney Poitier as Porgy couldn't be improved... Sammy Davis Jr. is the evil schemer, Sportin' Life, and he does his own singing -- which is hard, smart and persuasively cynical.\", 'Clyde Reid': 'One good thing about the production is that lots of our younger starlets and budding male stars got a chance to \"spread their wings and strut their stuff\" before a major audience.

Cohen': 'Somewhere in Porgy and Bess something is missing. The bursting excitement, in the main. The transfer from the stage to the screen has been accomplished with conscientiousness but without inspiration.', 'George Bourke': '[A] near perfect bit of cinematic art.', 'Jay Carmody': 'Verve and vitality have been sacrificed in the big picture directed by Otto Preminger in favor of spectacle and sentimentality.', 'Helen Bower': 'This Porgy... has done its best to meet the challenge of turning an operetta of this nature into popular entertainment. If it sometimes seems slowed or stagey, the form of the musical melodrama rather than the film itself may have made this unavoidable.', 'Mae Tinee': \"Technically, it's a superb example of painstaking and polished film-making, and, altho there are times when it lacks life and motion, it's still very well worth seeing.\", 'George S. Schuyler': 'This American classic is written, played and presented with a dignity and artistry that so representative an example of American culture deserves.', 'Myles Standish': '[Poitier and Dandridge] convey the torrent of emotion strongly, reinforced by the luminous singing voices of Robert McFerrin and Adele Addison, which were dubbed in.', 'John Bustin': 'Of course, the principal ingredients -- the haunting musical score and the poignant story -- were already on hand, but this production enhances them greatly with a staging that is rich, artful and altogether stirring in every sense.', 'Penelope Gilliatt': \"Otto Preminger's film is ponderous and flat. It has nothing like the spirit of, for instance, his own Carmen Jones.\", 'Philip K. Scheuer': 'The praise must go much beyond these technical marvels. Porgy and Bess would not be the masterpiece it is if the 70-mm. film and the seven-channel sound were not equaled by the human element.', 'William Glover': 'Much of the great Gershwin score is sung by backstage performers -- only Miss Bailey and Davis vocalize on the sound track. But the fusing of actors and voices has been done with remarkable skill.', 'R.H. Gardner': 'In their eagerness to leave everything just as Gershwin left it, the adapters have done very little adapting... Aside from this weakness -- and I consider it a major one -- the Goldwyn Porgy is a commendable job.', 'Sherwin Kane': \"The  production shines with memorable individual performances... Sidney Poitier as Porgy, Dorothy Dandridge as Bess, Brock Peters as Crown, Sammy Davis, Jr. as Sportin' Life and Pearl Bailey as Maria are outstanding.\", 'P.S.

Andre Previn's musical direction is inspiring.\", 'Harold Whitehead': \"Perhaps best and the shortest way of praising this film, and it deserves all the accolades it gets, is to say that for anyone who is not familiar with or has never seen George Gershwin's folk opera, this is the finest possible introduction.\", 'Richard Harrity': '[Porgy and Bess]  has been made into a handsome motion picture by that elder genius of the colossal, Mr. Samuel Goldwyn. In fact, the filming of Porgy and Bess is a bit too handsome and a mite  too pretty, thereby sacrificing compassion for color.', 'Jack Curtis': \"The film version of the famous Broadway production certainly has plenty of somethin'. Specifically, there are brilliant splashes of color, intricate set designs, interesting photography, and an outstanding cast.\", 'Bob Blackburn': \"The pace is pretty hot and heavy without the reliefs that might make it a less exhausting experience. But these are faults, and it isn't faults that distinguish this picture. It's technically superb, musically delightful, and altogether rewarding.\", 'Alexander Walker': '[Preminger] washes the Todd-AO screen with filters to give the action \"mood.\" But I am tired of viewing musicals like this... as If through amber ski-goggles. However, shining through all this are the talents of Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge.', 'Colin Bennett': '[Porgy and Bess] is handsomely staged -- and \"staged\" is the operative word. This is not really film, but photographed, opera, set in an operatic frame of reference and moving at stage, not film, pace.', 'Times (UK) Staff': 'The overriding impression, however, is one of set scenes. songs and sequences, with the spotlight thrown less on fluid movement than on the conventions of opera and of theatre. This, in the end, amounts more to a subtraction than an addition.', 'SMH Staff': '[Preminger] has achieved a production that is lovely to the ear, sumptuously sombre to the eye (in cinematographer Leon Shamroy\\'s range of ambers and reds), and. occasionally, moving. The \"occasionally\" is the puzzle.', 'Guardian Staff': \"Samuel Goldwyn's production (directed by Otto Preminger) certainly does full justice to the score and that, where the score is relatively feeble, it bolsters up the dramatic action with devices possible on the screen but not on the stage.\", 'Richard Brody': 'Preminger and the cast overcome the opera’s contrivances and stereotypes to recapture Gershwin’s underlying humanistic vision of celebration and deliverance.', 'TIME Staff': 'Porgy and Bess is only a moderate and intermittent success as a musical show; as an attempt to produce a great work of cinematic art, it is a sometimes ponderous failure.', 'Shadow Stage': 'Producer Samuel Goldwyn and director Otto Preminger have assembled it with such artistry and loving care that it almost seems to have been written for the movies.', 'Emanuel Levy': \"One of the most underestimated movie musicals, based on Gershwin's masterpiece, Porgy and Bess receives a lavish production from Otto Preminger in an all-black, Oscar-nominated picture, starring Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge.\", 'TV Guide Staff': \"The brilliant score by the Gershwins and DuBose Heyward, however, will last forever, while Preminger's veteran cameraman, Leon Shamroy, did a wonderful job and the art direction by Serge Krizman and Joseph Wright is sensational.\", 'Bosley Crowther': 'This is a stunning, exciting and moving film, packed with human emotions and cheerful and mournful melodies. It bids fair to be as much a classic on the screen as it is on the stage.', 'Film4 Staff': \"That it stands as an entertaining spectacle and the director's best musical is secondary in interest to the Hollywood politics surrounding it.\", 'Phil Hall': 'A mediocre curio.', \"Emily O'Neill\": \"Should this Porgy and Bess be locked away?

Lin': \"Curran's deliberate pace captures the quietness of the setting of Five Nights in Maine, but the thinness of her script is what makes the film feel sluggish.\", 'Michael Snydel': \"Maris Curran's Five Nights in Maine has very little new to offer.\", 'Miriam Di Nunzio': \"The dialogue is minimalistic, and most of it courtesy of Lucinda's cruel taunts that cut like a knife. But even those moments are never fully explored.\", 'Todd Jorgenson': 'With its intimate setting and deliberate pace, the film feels like an acting workshop that might have worked better on stage.', 'S. Jhoanna Robledo': 'Quiet drama has strong acting but needs more story.', 'Adam Graham': 'Too much goes unsaid and too many issues are unresolved. The scenery is nice, but \"Five Nights in Maine\" just isn\\'t worth the trip.', 'Russ Fischer': \"Curran guides the cast to commendable performances across the board, with Oyelowo and Wiest delivering controlled, nuanced work to fill in the script's generous negative space.\", 'Gary Goldstein': 'The dreary postmortem drama \"Five Nights in Maine\" is barely kept afloat by the gravitas of dueling leads David Oyelowo and Dianne Wiest.', 'Neil Genzlinger': 'A believable character study that may not draw crowds but certainly challenges its two lead actors.', 'Scott Tobias': \"We're left to guess how they feel at the beginning of the film and we don't learn much more by the end.\", 'Tirdad Derakhshani': \"Curran's script gives the actors too little substance with which to work their magic. The filmmaker's minimalist style is too sparse for the material.\", 'Matt Prigge': 'It\\'s a small movie, often to a fault. But every time you\\'re about to write it off as \"Generic Grief Indie #451,\" it surprises you.', 'Nigel M. Smith': \"Her two exceptional stars do their best to convey their animosity via simmering glances. But in the end, Curran's muted approach does them no favors.\", 'Brian Orndorf': 'Just watching these two spar in \"Maine\" would be enough to satisfy, but Curran has prepared something special, transforming a simple tale of reconnection into a labyrinth of surging, confusing emotions.', 'Rex Reed': 'The effect is a series of vignettes that fail to hold attention even though the movie clocks in at a merciful 83 minutes.', 'Tony Hinds': \"The film's reluctance to sully its hands in schmaltzy Nicolas Sparks-esque digressions leaves us with a threadbare and anticlimactic narrative.\", 'Simi Horwitz': 'Inscrutable and not especially compelling.', 'Jesse Hassenger': \"Curran's film is at once admirable in its avoidance of easy sentiment and kind of predictable once its quiet seriousness makes itself known (which is to say very early on).\", 'Christopher Gray': \"Maris Curran never reconciles the film's impulse to interiority with its weakness for hothouse melodrama.\", 'Roger Moore': 'A fine cast gives us two nights worth of movie, but without nearly as much to chew on as the stingy-with-story director would have you believe.', 'Michael D. Reid': '[David Oyelowo and Dianne Wiest] bring impressive naturalism to their restrained performances.', 'Tim Grierson': 'A commendably restrained drama that turns out to be too muted for its own good.', 'David Nusair': 'Five nights in Maine suffers from an uneventful and thoroughly subdued feel that does, particularly as time progresses, render its positive attributes moot.', 'Andrew Barker': \"Curran's tasteful, challenging yet ultimately inscrutable debut feature never quite lives up to the caliber of her fine cast.\", 'Jon Frosch': 'Intriguing parts, underwhelming whole.'}\n",
