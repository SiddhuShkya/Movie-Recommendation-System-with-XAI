Instead, they've made a film that might have seemed hip 10 years back but now seems dated, cold and cynical.\", 'Stefan Pape': \"Though the simplicity of this narrative, and the restricted, confined setting is a unique selling point for Nichols, it's also suffocating, and to the filmmaker's detriment.\", 'Geoffrey Macnab': \"This attempt as a latter-day screwball romance, released in time for Valentine's Day, is charming in parts but also contrived.\", 'Allan Hunter': 'The easy charm of stars Miles Teller and Analeigh Tipton more than compensates for a screenplay that never quite bridges the divide between old-fashioned romance and the cruder tone that seems par for the course in modern comedy.', 'David Parkinson': 'Charming performances from both leads and insightful vignettes makes up for occasional clumsy writing and plot developments.', 'John Ferguson': \"While there is plenty of rude banter and are a few good laughs, Mark Hammer's script is neither witty nor insightful enough to carry the load.\", 'Mike McCahill': \"Two Night Stand is a notch below popping to Nando's on the list of things to do with a significant other this Valentine's.\", 'Rich Cline': 'Miles Teller and Analeigh Tipton are smart enough actors to make the most of this uneven romantic comedy', 'Nikki Baughan': 'Two Night Stand is as generic as they come.', 'Tom Huddleston': 'Yet another would-be charming male fantasy about how even the smartest girls can be charmed out of their pants by a schlubby doofus with a penchant for heavy negging.', 'MaryAnn Johanson': \"Apparently written by the same people who write the ridiculous quizzes and sex-tip listicles in Cosmo and Men's Health...\", 'Christine N. Ziemba': \"Teller has a relaxed, onscreen persona that endeared audiences in last year's The Spectacular Now, and Tipton keeps up brilliantly in her first lead role, effortlessly alternating between an ingenue and sex kitten.\", 'Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat': 'Two members of the Millennial generation trying to figure out the formula for intimacy.', 'Elias Savada': \"Two Night Stand takes place between Christmas and New Year's, but there's no holiday mirth to cheer about here.\", 'Sam Fragoso': 'A foreign film without subtitles - a movie whose language is incomprehensible to anyone who has truthfully been involved.', 'Todd Jorgenson': '... more like a failed sitcom pilot than an insightful look at contemporary relationships.', 'Jim Judy': \"This is really just a standard, R-rated rom-com in cinematic sheep's clothing that follows the usual trajectory of the genre. (Complete Content Review for Parents Also Available)\", \"Mike D'Angelo\": 'Two Night Stand is much more comfortable telling than it is showing', 'S. Jhoanna Robledo': 'Offbeat romcom takes frank look at sex, relationships.', 'Glenn Kenny': \"A slight but not-unengaging Young Person's Romantic Comedy ...\", 'Travis Hopson': 'Modestly charming and even perceptive.', 'Tirdad Derakhshani': 'Featuring strong dialogue and terrific performances, the film has moments of near-brilliance, but falls apart with a lame, conventional ending.', 'Kirk Honeycutt': 'A modest film that showcases the talent of Miles Teller and Analeigh Tipton.', 'Betsy Sharkey': 'It turns out \"Two Night Stand\" is a one-act sex comedy badly in need of two more - acts, not nights.', 'Ben Kenigsberg': \"It's hard not to root for this couple - and, more to the point, these actors - to get together again.\", 'John Hanlon': 'A \"romantic comedy\" that is neither romantic or comedic. It is as unambitious as its misguided main characters.', 'Stephanie Merry': 'As with most romantic comedies, the story falls apart with the formulaic injection of tension and the ensuing resolution, which is utterly outrageous even by rom-com standards.', 'Mick LaSalle': '\"Two Night Stand\" has its moments. But moments are all this movie has - and all its characters are likely to get.', 'Marsha McCreadie': \"These two are nice, though, which is nice. But the film is a date you won't want to repeat, despite its sparkly out-of-left-field conclusion. It's just another casual encounter, not a lasting thing.\", 'Jenni Miller': 'Two Night Stand comes so close to saying something insightful about dating in the digital age that the inevitable letdown is more bitter than usual.', 'Amy Nicholson': 'Honest? Sure. Romantic, funny, and charming? Not even close.', 'Elizabeth Weitzman': 'Teller is, by far, the best thing about this easygoing, stubbornly generic independent romance from Max Nichols.', 'Sara Stewart': 'As a testament to the power of good old-fashioned face-to-face conversation as aphrodisiac, the film works fairly well, if not as a primer on safe online dating.', 'James Rocchi': 'Charming but contrived, more slapdash than sexy and more interested in late-act reversals than real-life relationships, \"Two Night Stand\" isn\\'t really going to scratch anyone\\'s itchy spots, no matter how far it\\'s willing to go in trying to do so.', 'Nick McCarthy': \"It's attempt at conveying a candid portrait of contemporary hookup culture and the dishonesty of online dating profiles, but the film's sentiments are all past their expiration date.\", 'Stephen Farber': 'A likeable but forgettable trifle.', 'Ella Taylor': '\"Two Night Stand\\'s\" strength lies in the doubts and the ambivalence it expresses about the way we love now.', 'Tim Grierson': 'A perfectly pleasant, utterly disposable romantic comedy.'}\n",
